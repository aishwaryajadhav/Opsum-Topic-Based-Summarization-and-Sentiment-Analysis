# Summarization

In the summarization process, we find a subset of sentences which contains sentences very different from each other and will represent the main idea or the main content of the text. 

We incorporate the following properties into summaries:

 Relevance: Summary should contain informative textual units that are relevant to the user.
 
 Redundancy: Summaries should not contain multiple textual units that convey the same information.

 Length: Summary is bounded in length.
