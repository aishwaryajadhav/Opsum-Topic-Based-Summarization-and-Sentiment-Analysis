# Opsum-Topic-Based-Summarization-and-Sentiment-Analysis

Opsum is a system for topic-based opinion summarization and sentiment analysis of mobile phone reviews. It enables users to decide whether to purchase or not based on a summary of the reviews for that mobile phone.

Selection of useful reviews is done from these collections of organized reviews. We discuss the effectiveness of using GRNNs and LSTMs for sentiment analysis and their trade-offs.
